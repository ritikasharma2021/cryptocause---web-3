# Prompt: Build Web3 Crypto-Charity dApp on ICP with ckUSDT

**Title:**  
Develop a Web3-based  Crypto-Charity Donation Platform on ICP Supporting ckUSDT

---

## Description  
Build a decentralized charity platform similar to Saweria, but fully on‚Äëchain, powered by the Internet Computer (ICP). Provide a seamless donation experience where users can donate using ckUSDT ‚Äî a wrapped USDT token on ICP ‚Äî via Web3 wallet integration. The platform should include transparent donation records, optional escrow or milestone-based releases, and the issuance of NFT-based donor receipts.

## üîß Feature Requirements

| Requirement             | Details |
|-------------------------|---------|
| **Wallet Integration**  | Connect via Plug, Stoic, or Internet Identity for authentication. |
| **Token Support**       | Focus on **ckUSDT** (wrapped ERC‚Äë20 USDT on ICP). |
| **Donation Modules**    | Canister functions like `donate(amount, campaignId)`, `getDonations(campaignId)`, `withdrawFunds(recipientId)`. |
| **Escrow / Milestone Management** | Implement mechanisms for controlled fund release (time-based or DAO voting). |
| **Transparency Dashboard** | On-chain view: donor, amount, timestamp; UI visualization. |
| **Receipt NFTs (Optional)** | Mint an NFT (e.g., ICRC-721) upon donation as proof of donation. |
| **Frontend**            | React + TypeScript with Web3 agent (`@dfinity/agent`) and ledger interactions. |
| **Backend**             | ICP Canister logic in Rust or Motoko, storing donation data on-chain. |

## üöÄ Technical Stack

- **Blockchain Layer:**  
  - **ckUSDT** minted and managed via ICRC‚Äë1/2 token canisters (wrapped USDT on ICP).  
  - Use standard `transfer` / `balanceOf` interfaces for donation transfers.

- **Canister Components:**  
  - **Donation Canister:**  
    - `donate(campaignId: Text, amount: Nat, donor: Principal)`  
    - `getDonations(campaignId)` ‚Üí `[Donation]`  
    - `withdraw(campaignId, recipientPrincipal)`  
  - **NFT Canister (Optional):** Mint receipt NFT per donor.

- **Frontend Flow:**  
  1. User connects wallet (Plug / Stoic / II)  
  2. Select donation amount in ckUSDT  
  3. `approve` ckUSDT transfer  
  4. Call `donate(...)` method via agent to canister  
  5. Display real-time donation listing

- **Bridge Process:**  
  - Users obtain ckUSDT by bridging USDT from Ethereum/BSC via protocols like Appic Bridge or OneSec.  
  - ckUSDT is tokens compatible with ICP wallets and can be used on-chain with low-fee transactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tasks

1. **Integrate ckUSDT Token:**
   - Use ICRC-1 canister interface in frontend.
   - Ensure liquidity and balance management.

2. **Implement Donation Canister:**
   - Store data structures for donation or campaign.
   - Validate calls and permissions.
   - On-chain event logs for each `donate()`.

3. **Frontend Components:**
   - Wallet connection screen.
   - Campaign listing & donation input.
   - Real-time donation tracking.

4. **Optional Features:**
   - Escrow or time-locked withdrawal.
   - NFT minting for each donor.
   - Admin dashboard for campaign creators (with `withdraw`, stats).

5. **Testing & Deployment:**
   - Deploy on ICP Testnet.
   - Simulate USDT bridging, donation flows, withdrawal flows.
   - Final deployment to ICP Mainnet for hackathon submission.

## üéØ Why This Setup Works

- **Seamless Donor Experience:** Users donate stablecoins (USDT) without worrying about volatile crypto.  
- **On‚Äëchain Transparency:** Every donation is recorded and verifiable publicly.  
- **ICP's Interoperability:** Use of ckUSDT exemplifies chain‚Äëkey cross‚Äëchain integration.  
- **Optional Innovation Layers:** Escrow, DAO governance, NFT receipts add trust & engagement.
